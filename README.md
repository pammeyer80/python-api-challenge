## WeatherPy 

### City Data
Identifies over 500 cities based on randomly generated latitude and longitude coordinates

Gather Weather Data
* Performs a weather check on each city using the OpenWeatherMap API
* Returns a list of each city as it's city weather data is gathered

Save Results

Remove cities with humidity over 100%

### Latitude Analyses
Includes the following Scatter Plots
* Temperature vs. Latitude Plot
* Humidity vs. Latitude Plot
* Cloudiness vs. Latitude Plot
* Wind Speed vs. Latitude Plot

### Linear Regression
Includes the following Linear Regression analyses
* Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Southern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Northern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression

### Observations
Identifies 3 insights based on the analyzed data. 

## VacationPy 
 
### City Weather Data 
View cities and their related weather

### Humidity Heatmap
